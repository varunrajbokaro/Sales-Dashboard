The dashboard was created using several advanced Excel features. Power Query was used for cleaning and transforming raw sales data to ensure accuracy and consistency. Power Pivot was utilized to handle large datasets effectively and to build a robust data model. Data Modeling techniques were applied to establish relationships between multiple tables, enabling flexible and dynamic analysis. Additionally, conditional formatting was applied to highlight key trends, outliers, and variances for quick interpretation of results.
